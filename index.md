These are the mock pages that we used as guidance for our project.  The mock pages involve quite a bit of functionality on each mock template.  The functions that we are planning on using involves a search bar, calendar template, description for each event, add event icon, and a settings icon.

## Milestone 1

The goal for Milestone 1 was to implement a somewhat working web application using ReactJS, Meteor, MongoDB, and Semantic UI.  We started off by creating "rough-draft" templates of the project website.  By creating these rough-drafts, we began to cut into our creativity and functionality by asking ourselves various innovative and unique questions.  For example, what would the site cater to in the grand-scheme of things?  What would it look like?  What is the target audience for this website?  and so on.

Here are some "behind-the-scenes" drawings that we used as mock-up drafts in the creation of our web application.
