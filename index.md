## Milestone 1

The goal for Milestone 1 was to implement a somewhat working web application using ReactJS, Meteor, MongoDB, and Semantic UI.  We started off by creating "rough-draft" templates of the project website.  By creating these rough-drafts, we began to cut into our creativity and functionality by asking ourselves various innovative and unique questions.  For example, what would the site cater to in the grand-scheme of things?  What would it look like?  What is the target audience for this website?  and so on.  Please click [here](https://github.com/KWong41/ICS414Project/projects/1) for more information about Milestone 1.

Here are some "behind-the-scenes" drawings that we used as mock-up drafts in the creation of our web application.

## Community Feedback

- Love the idea! I think it does need a bit of development though. I think a site like this is definitely useful for UH students. If it catches on, I really think it has potential to grow.

- Clean UI

- I like the color scheme and it was easy and fast for me to list my item.

- Very visually nice. Easy to navigate. Looks professional.

- I like that you can browse through items by category or search for a specific item using the search bar. Also, I like that you are able to contact the admin to let them know if there's an issue with something. Overall, the design is minimalistic and functional. I especially like the look of the landing page--it looks very professional. 

- The mobile interface definitely needs work: the images are skewed, and the text fields are sized in such a way that they're difficult to read or enter text into (during the sign-up process). The desktop version looks great though. It's clean and simple, as a site should be.

- categorized well 

- search bar is a little limited: can only search for item name and nothing else.
